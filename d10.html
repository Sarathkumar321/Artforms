            <h1><u>Pulikali</u></h1>
            <p>
                Pulikali, also known as Kaduvakali, is a traditional folk art form that originated in the Indian state of Kerala. It is a colorful and lively dance performance in which performers paint themselves like tigers and dance to the beats of traditional drums.

                The word "pulikali" translates to "play of the tigers" in Malayalam, the language of Kerala. The performance usually takes place during the annual Onam festival, which is celebrated in the state to mark the harvest season.
                
                Pulikali involves a group of men who paint their bodies to resemble tigers, complete with intricate black and orange stripes, and wear elaborate headgear and costumes. They then dance to the rhythm of drums and other traditional musical instruments.
                
                The origin of Pulikali is traced back to the 18th century, when it was introduced by the King of Kochi as a form of entertainment during the Onam festival. Over time, the art form evolved and became an important part of Kerala's cultural heritage.
                
                Apart from its entertainment value, Pulikali is also considered a way to spread awareness about the need to protect and conserve tigers, which are an endangered species. The performance often includes messages about the importance of conservation and environmental protection.
                
                Today, Pulikali has gained widespread popularity and is performed in various parts of Kerala, as well as in other parts of the country and even internationally. The art form has become a symbol of the rich cultural heritage of Kerala, and efforts are being made to preserve and promote it for future generations.
